Yogyakarta, or affectionately called Jogja, is a cultural city rich in history and natural beauty. As a local tour guide, I often take tourists to top destinations such as:

## Borobudur: The Largest Buddhist Temple in the World

Borobudur Temple is one of UNESCO's world heritage sites. Built in the 9th century, this temple has 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha stupas. Morning tours are highly recommended to avoid crowds and enjoy the spectacular sunrise.

## Yogyakarta Palace: The Royal Palace

The Palace is the center of Javanese culture. Tourists can learn traditional dances, see keris collections, and participate in traditional ceremonies. Don't forget to try traditional herbal medicine around the palace!

## Malioboro: Shopping and Culinary Center

Malioboro Street is a paradise for souvenir lovers. From batik to local specialties like gudeg and bakpia, everything is here. I always recommend evening tours for a more lively atmosphere.

Yogyakarta is not just about temples, but also about its people and culture. Let's explore together!
